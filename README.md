                    There once was a coder, skilled and bright, 
                    Whose talent soared to new heights. 
                    Promoted to manager, they took the lead, 
                    Navigating projects with remarkable speed.
                    
                    But their heart still yearned for lines of code, 
                    The syntax, the logic, it never gets old. 
                    Managing teams, they excelled with finesse, 
                    Yet deep down, they missed the coding process.
                    
                    In meetings and reports, they showcased their might, 
                    Balancing deadlines, keeping projects in sight. 
                    But late at night, in the code's embrace, 
                    They yearned for the challenges only devs face.
    
                    So the coder-turned-manager made a decree, 
                    To find the balance and set their heart free. 
                    They coded on weekends, indulged their desire, 
                    For the love of development burned like a fire.
                    
                    So here's to the developer who became a manager, 
                    Embracing challenges with skills and candor. 
                    In the world of code, they still found their way, 
                    Balancing leadership and coding, day by day.
